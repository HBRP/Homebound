# Homebound

Homebound is an open-source collection of plugins that utilize the "em_fw" interface to communicate with a rust backend. The rust backend communicates with a PostgreSQL database, instead of the typical MySQL/MariaDB databases.

Data-Orientated design and DRY are driving principals in this project.
