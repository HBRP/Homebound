# Homebound

Homebound is an open-source collection of plugins that utilize the "em_dal" interface to communicate with a rust backend.

Data-Orientated design and DRY are driving principals in this project.

## Interal resources

All internal resources use the MIT License and are authored by the Homebound team.

## External resources

External resources are resources that have been gathered from the FiveM community. To use any of those resources, you must abide by the original author's license.

## How do I run it?

Unless you're working in conjuction with the homebound team, you'll need to find or write an implementation of rusty-m (Our Webservice that handles communication with a postgres database) and photo-uploader (Our Webservice that handles uploading data to imgur). This repository contains only code that needs to directly run on the fivem platform. Webservices are not included.

## Why are webservices not included?

While we value opensource and use opensource software in this repo, we do want contributions to the Homebound project to strictly benefit Homebound.
