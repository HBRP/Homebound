# Homebound

Homebound is an open-source collection of plugins that utilize the "em_fw" interface to communicate with a rust backend. The rust backend communicates with a PostgreSQL database, instead of the typical MySQL/MariaDB databases.

The collection of plugins is designed and maintained by experienced software developers. Data-Orientated design and DRY are driving principals in this project.

The projects consists of both internal and external resources, along with sql files to setup a basic version of our postgres database and the rust webservice.

## Interal resources

All internal resources use the MIT License and are authored by the Homebound team.

## External resources

External resources are resources that have been gathered from the FiveM community. To use any of those resources, you must abide by the original author's license.

External resources are often heavily modified to fit the needs of the project. 

## Contribute

Contributions to the project require that the developer forfeit ownership of the modifications to the project itself, or to the external plugin.
